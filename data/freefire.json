		"name": "Free Fire skins permanently",
		"description": "The weapons with expensive and rare skins are more powerful and attractive than default versions. Therefore players top up a lot of diamonds to unlock gun skins in the free fire. Another best thing about the gun skin is the opponent afraid to fight with you. Also, you will look smart than others in the lobby, training ground, and battleground by using expensive weapons. But what about the player who doesn’t have money to buy weapon skins in FF? The expensive and rare things don’t come for free. The non-spending player has to go through other ideas to obtain these things. For example, sometimes the game brings discount offers, and sometimes, you will get rewarding event tasks. Also, there are some other methods to unlock these weapon skins for free in Fee fire.",

		"description": "The weapon royale is the best spin system to get some rare gun skins, but it requires luck to unlock them. It requires 40 diamonds for a single spin and 400 diamonds for 11 spins. Also, you can use the ‘voucher’ to spin the weapon royale. So, if you have a voucher, you can say it is the best method to unlock free gun skins without diamonds in Free fire.",

		"description": "The faded wheel is another best method to obtain legendary weapon skin. It is also a spin from which you can upgrade your Evo guns. The price of the faded wheel depends upon how many times you spin the wheel. But, for the first spin, you have to pay nothing-it’s free. Also, remove two unwanted items from the reward list so that you can unlock permanent legendary gun skins with a high chance in the Free fire.",
