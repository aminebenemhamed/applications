		"description": "The weapons with expensive and rare skins are more powerful and attractive than default versions. Therefore players top up a lot of diamonds to unlock gun skins in the free fire. Another best thing about the gun skin is the opponent afraid to fight with you. Also, you will look smart than others in the lobby, training ground, and battleground by using expensive weapons. But what about the player who doesn’t have money to buy weapon skins in FF? The expensive and rare things don’t come for free. The non-spending player has to go through other ideas to obtain these things. For example, sometimes the game brings discount offers, and sometimes, you will get rewarding event tasks. Also, there are some other methods to unlock these weapon skins for free in Fee fire.",
